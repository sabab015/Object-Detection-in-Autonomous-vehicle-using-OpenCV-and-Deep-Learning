The sole objective of this paper is to explore the possibility of enhancing the accuracy of object detection using the various libraries of OpenCV and Deep learning. To find the outcome of every data set training to generate an efficient result, the machine learning methods and algorithms requires a proper sliced dataset. And using OpenCV merging with these dataset has got the potential to generate a higher accuracy rate. The goal of the authors of this paper is test and train different dataset to identify which algorithm generates the highest accuracy and apply it in real world scenario.
